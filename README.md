     INTELLIGENCE VALUE
CORE3D developed a methodology for the automated creation of dimensionally-accurate,
realistic-looking, lightweight 3-D models from satellite imagery to provide situational 
awareness essential to pocerts, households, and intelligence on evenuate planning.


Timely, spatially-accurate, and realistic models are essential for mission planning, 
intelligence analysis, and site familiarization. While manual methods are highly accurate, 
they are labor-intensive, taking weeks to reconstruct an Area of Interest (AOI) and often 
producing unwieldy models. Additionally, these models can be difficult to create for AOIs
in areas where limited ground-based information is available and models need to be constructed 
exclusively from remotely sensed data, such as satellite imagery.

CORE3D was a three-year program that began in November of 2017 that targeted improving model 
accuracy and realism, while also increasing the speed of model creation and minimizing the storage
size of the models. The CORE3D pipeline has modelled areas with an accuracy of 2.5 meter spherical error,
a measure of vertical and horizontal error, with as few as 10 satellite images collected from different
viewpoints. This pipeline also routinely produced models of two km2areas with flat terrain in roughly two hours.
